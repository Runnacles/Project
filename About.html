	  <h2>About</h2>
	  <p class="aboutText">Research was undertaken to gather people's opinions on the gender gap within IT and what aspects need to be changed to ensure that the gap decreases in the future.</p>
	  <div id  = "graph1" class = "graph"></div>
	  <p class="aboutText" id="graph1Text">The graph above shows the results after asking people their opinion on what the most important factor that needs to change for the gender gap to decrease. Education was the most popular response with 39% of people choosing it. However the other responses of Society and Workplace stigma are not much lower in the percentage of responses they recieved. It can be inferred that all these aspects need to change for a noticable change in the number of females in the IT sector to be seen.</p>
	  <div id = "graph2" class = "graph"></div>
	  <p class="aboutText" id="graph2Text">The graph above and the graph below show the break down of female and male students studying Computer Science BSc and Games Computing BSc at the University of Lincoln respectively. By looking at the graphs it is evident that there is a clear disprepancy in the number of male and female students enrolled on each course. Over a 7 year period the number of females enrolled on the Computer Science course increased from 11 to 37 which is a percentage increase of 236%. However the number of males enrolled increased from 114 to 511 which is a precentage increase of 348% which completely dwarves the increase of females on the course. <br> While this is a small look at the state of the gender gap in one university, it is also evident when looking the the gender ratio for A Level students across the whole of the UK. </p>
	  <div id = "graph3" class = "graph"></div>
	  <p class="aboutText" id="graph4Text">While the number of female students studying Computing at A Level has increased from 314 students to 1211 students across the country (seen in the graph below), the number of females studying IT has decreased from 3421 to 1772 students. This means that there has been an overall reduction in the number of female students in IT/computer related subjects of 752 students in 5 years. On the other hand, the number of male students studying IT has decreased by 2187 students across the 5 years, the number of males studying Computing has increased by 5218 students. This means that there has been an overall increase of 3031 male students studying IT/Computing related subjects at A Level. Even though the number of female Computing students is slowly going up, due to the more dramatic increase of male students the gender gap just becomes more prominent.</p>
