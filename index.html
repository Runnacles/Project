		<h2>Did you know? </h2>
		<p class="columnText">There is a huge difference in the number of females in technology in the UK.<br><br> Only 17% of peoppl working in technology are female. Out of all the students studying computing and IT at A Level only 18% are female.<br><br> Even though the number of women working in IT, due to the number of males also dramatically increasing, female representation has stalled over the last 10 years. <br><br>This means that there is a huge pool of potential knowledge not being used because females do not want to go in to IT.</p>

		<h2>What can we do?</h2>
		<p class="columnText">There are many potential reasons why women do not want to go into IT. One of these is that IT and technology is often seen as a stereotypically male subject at school.<br><br> Many companies are now actively trying to increase the number of females within the sector however it is not closing the gap. If more girls are encouraged to pursue IT further in education, then there will be more women to help fill this gap in the future. <br><br> We at EqualITy feel that changing the way computer science and IT is taught is one of the key aspects that will help increase the number of females in the technology sector. <br><br> Showing girls that they will not be alone if they want to go in to IT by identifying prominent role models is one way to increase their confidence. <br><br> Use our resources as a base to encourage more girls to have an interest in technology. </p>
